                                <p>It is through a hybrid practice within academia, community and professional sectors, that the `testing’ of dance/movement vocabulary through exploring, investigating and creating new ways of moving through artistic collaboration, devising new methodologies for creating original and thought provoking works that encourage participation and cross fertilisation of art forms. It is my contention that exploring dance through various creative contexts such as, multi-media installations, sited and re-sited spaces and filmed dance works, opens the boundaries of dance to critical cultural debates and to develop new aesthetics for the next generation of dance makers.</p>
